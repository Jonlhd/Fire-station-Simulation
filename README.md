# Fire-station-Simulation
A C++ project simulating the operations of a real fire station at the Lebanese Civil Defence in Jeita.

The application manages:
Personnel scheduling across the week
Mission assignments (Fire, Rescue, Aid) with dynamic vehicle and item allocation
Personnel records tracking hours worked and mission achievements

Technologies and Concepts:
C++ (OOP, modular design)
map, set, vector, forward_list (linked list)
Real-world data for 30 personnel, 5 vehicles, 52 emergency items
Clean separation into .h and .cpp files
Time complexities documented inside the code
Simple CLI (command-line interface) menu-driven interaction

Project Goals:
Demonstrate efficient data management in emergency services
Model scheduling, mission dispatch, and personnel activity tracking
Follow best practices in commenting, modularity, and performance analysis
